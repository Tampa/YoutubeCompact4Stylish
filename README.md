# Why does this exist?
Because whoever is doing the styling at Youtube is head over heels in love with whitespace and wasting tons of space on the page.
The design is unable to hold the most relevant information without requiring the user to scroll.
Only a handful of videos are shown on a lot of pages which limits exposure to only those videos fortunate enough to be within that initial scope of the page.
Buttons should not be 70% whitespace and 30% text, it's wasteful and only makes sense for touch devices, which in most cases use the mobile design anyways.

# How to use:

- Install a CSS override plugin like Stylish: https://userstyles.org/
- Create a new Style and import the contents of style.css into it
- Set the override to apply to urls beginning with youtube.com

# Contributing
Youtube has a nasty habit of changing their style without warning and often in the most drastic ways so please feel free to open issue tickets regarding theme changes or bugs.
Also feel free to submit merge requests restoring useful data or adding better design for the pages.
